    	<b>London</b> has long been the capital of the United Kingdom fashion industry and has a wide range of foreign designs which have integrated with modern British styles. Typical, British design is smart but innovative yet recently has become more and more unconventional, fusing traditional styles with modern techniques. Vintage styles play an important role in the British fashion and styling industry. Stylists regularly 'mix and match' the old with the new, which gives British style that unique, bohemian aesthetic that many of the other fashion capitals try to imitate. Irish fashion (both design and styling) is also heavily influenced by fashion trends from Britain. Famous British brands and designers include Burberry, Paul Smith, Alfred Dunhill, Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, John Richmond, Neil Barrett, Matthew Williamson, Hussein Chalayan, Gareth Pugh, Stella McCartney, Mulberry, Thomas Pink and Vivienne Westwood.

The reason why is my childhood dream! <br>
Firstly I was interested in <b><i>designing the clothes</i></b>. I had some drawings (I still have them).<br> However, I was interested in IT as well. 
 I understood that I am not really good at drawing and <br> I am not interested in writing essays, reading and staff like that. <br>
 I have decided to combine both interests in one. That is why, even I am not good at <b><i> fashion,</i></b> <br> by myself - I don't have <b><i>glitter dresses</i></b>,<br> and I am not wearing clothes by <b><i>trands and famous designers</i></b>.
