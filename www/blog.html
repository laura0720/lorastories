                    <p>If you read a post in About page, I have written that, I was stressed in highschool because of new society. Teachers at new school were really angry, and it was Soviet Union period teachers. Some of them were unfair, and they didn't accepted me. In the class there were 3 or 4 groupings of girls, where they had own circle of friends. I really was confused in these groupings, because the circle wasn't in my interest. After what I met other girls, that have same way of thinking as mine, and we had our group of 4 girls. Everytime we were helping each other, after school we were taking photos and other entertainment. However, those teachers chose students by their characteristics and it is the worst thing, when your teacher not paying attention to all students in class. They were making desicions on how the pupil was worn and how he was studying, and the main is WHOS CHILD HE WAS. Few classmates were children of other teachers, so they were kind of "holy".</p>

                    <p>There are so many tour companies, that can provide you with all exibitions, flights and other comforts. So we went to the one of these companies, and manager there told me to start from college and made an advertisement of Columbia College in Vancouver. She dissuaded me from Toronto and we decided and stopped on Vancouver College which I still regret about that. I wanted to go to the university from the first time, but some 'smart people' with their advices make it really difficult. The Manager M. said that it will be difficult to study at university so I should start from college. However, when I met people there from Russia they all started from university :(. So sometimes we should not believe people, and everytime listen to their advices.</p>
