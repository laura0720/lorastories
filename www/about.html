                    <p>My name is Laura. I was born in 20th July in 1996. I live in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. My parents are engineers at oil and gas company TCO. </p>
                    <p>My mother says, that I used to be very powerful child. Even we walk to somwhere, I used to jump or run, or talk everytime :). Father dreamt about sending me to England to study, and he started preparing me from 2 years. I learnt how to count in English and knew the alphabet as well.</p>
                    <p>After all, I went to the pre-school academy, where I met my friends and started preparing to the school.</p>

                    <p>Stories at school always were funny and crazy. I have studied at 3 schools. In undergraduate I have studied at school #22 (Atyrau), from 5th grade to 7th grade I have studied at KAU (Kazakh-American University) and the last, from 8th grade till highschool I have studied at lyceum #17 (Atyrau). </p>
                    <p>Since I have had many changes in society, I was stressed to get used in one place after another. It was really hard to see new faces everytime, to meet with new teachers and again-again show them my knowledge, prove that I know the material from previous grades, and simply to have a good relationship with classmates. As you know from first grade, there are grouppings from few people, where girls made their own friends. At first and second schoolswe didn't have it in our class, however, at the last school we had it. I will tell about that in my other posts ;).</p>

                    <p>My mom at 9th grade, sent me to England. It was small town named Bournamouth, I have studied at summer Kings school. I have studied there for one month. Honestly, I didn't like this town and England itself because of the weather. It was rainy all the time, what gave us sad mood, and we wanted to come back home everytime. </p>
                    <p>Next year after England, I travelled to Toronto, Canada for one month. I have been in ILAC school in the summer. Toronto was very beautiful. I visited Niagara waterfall and other places. It was amazing! After that, I have decided to study at Toronto.</p>
                    <p>After graduation from school, I was preparing my documents for Columbia College in Vancouver, Canada. (The reason why I didn't go to the Toronto's college and why I have choosen the college not university, will write in the next posts). I have studied for 2 years there by program "University Transfer". And have transfered to Kazakh-British Technical University in Almaty. Now, I study there.</p>
